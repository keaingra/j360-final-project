      Kelseigh Ingram was born September 25, 1994 in Louisville, Kentucky to Trisha Ingram. There is no father on her birth certificate. She was raised in her native Boonville, Indiana by her mother and stepfather, construction worker Jason Howard, who she considers to be her actual father.

      Before she was born, Kelseigh was diagnosed with Turner Syndrome, a chromosomal disorder found 1 in 2,000 living people who were assigned female at birth. Also known as TS, it has symptoms such as short stature, infertility, and heart and kidney problems.

      She began taking growth hormone at the age of 4 and finished at 16 (she is now 4'11"). She is currently doing HRT (a common protocol among those with Turner Syndrome due to infertility). Like many other people with TS, Kelseigh plans to build her family through adoption.

      Kelseigh got her start in newspaper writing by being a member of her high school's newspaper starting the spring semester of her junior year. She has also written for the TSS Connect, the official magazine of the Turner Syndrome Society of the United States. She now blogs for The Huffington Post and has written reviews for the Indiana Daily Student. She was also involved in a broadcast media class her senior year that did the morning announcements. She has also taken a visual communications course while at IU that allowed her to work with Photoshop, InDesign, and FinalCut Pro.

      Aside from writing, Kelseigh's other great love is theatre. She did musicals with the Boonville High School drama department from the third grade until her senior year. She has also been in two of University Players' 22 Hour Play Fests.

      When she's not writing, doing schoolwork, or working in the dining hall, Kelseigh can be found watching Netflix and trading ridiculous memes with her younger sister.
